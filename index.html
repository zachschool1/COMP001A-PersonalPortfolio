            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p> I am an aspiring web developer with minimal experience looking to expand my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Next semester I look forward to learning C#. I have previously taken a course that Harvard offers for free, CS50x, where I learned a lot about how the computer works and how to get in the mindset of a computer programmer, but I am looking to sharpen my skills and focus on getting my Information Technology degree, which I will have after I finish my Full Stack Web Development courses through Lemoore College. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Currently I am working as a Life and Health Agent selling exclusive Life Insurance benefits only available to Veterans, Police Officers, Firefighters, Union Members, Professional Athletes and their loved ones.</p>

            <div id="p1">
                <h3>1. Incomplete project using MERN stack</h3>
                <p>My first project after CS50x, initially intended to be my final project, was a web application that I used MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js in order to build a calorie counting application. I ended up stopping after I created my own use authentication and had an API call to the Nutritionix API for data of each ingredient. I believe I had too large of a scope for a first project and doing JavaScript only was a bit of jumping head first into the deep end,</p>
            </div>
            <div id="p2">
                <h3>2. Incomplete project using Laravel</h3>
                <p> After learning how hard it was to create my own authentication, I decided to try and find a framework that would come with that portion done for me automatically. I created a Laravel application that is essentially the same as the previous project, but without implementing the actual API call, as I was learning PHP at the same time. </p>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div id="p3">
                <h3>3. Small project to learn Google Maps API</h3>
                <p> This project was one I created with Django and Python, as this was one of the things we learned in CS50x. It was a pretty basic google map application that also used the Routes API. It was capable of inserting points on a map and calculating the distance to drive from point A to point B, as well as various waypoints possible to include. This was made with heavy use from Copilot.</p>
                <br>

            <div id="p4">
                <h3>4. Simple text-to-speech application</h3>
                <p> This project was something I created around the same time as the previous application. It looked ugly on purpose, and it's main purpose was to read my sales script for Life Insurance. I did end up using it to create fake Reddit stories so I could upload on TikTok and Facebook, but I didn't do more than two videos before I wanted to move on with learning.</p>
